# CPU Scheduling Simulator

### Operating Systems – Project 01

## Overview

This project is a **CPU Scheduling Simulator** built using **Python (Flask)** for the backend and **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** for the frontend. It visually demonstrates the behavior of multiple CPU scheduling algorithms. The project helps users understand and compare algorithm performance in terms of turnaround and response times.

## Features

- Visual and interactive web-based simulator.
- Supports **five major scheduling algorithms**:
  - FCFS (First Come, First Serve)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First - Non-preemptive)
  - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First - Preemptive)
  - RR (Round Robin)
  - MLFQ (Multilevel Feedback Queue)
- Supports:
  - Manual or Random input mode
  - Gantt chart generation
  - Simulation speed configuration
  - Calculation of Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Response Time
- Beautiful **dark-themed UI** with neon hover effects.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python 3, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (custom + Roboto fonts), JavaScript (vanilla)
- **Design:** Responsive layout with flexbox/grid
